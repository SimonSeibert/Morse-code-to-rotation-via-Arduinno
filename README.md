# Morse code to rotation via Arduinno

*What is the project*:
This is the source code for a translator, which essentially mimics the setup of the movie *"The Martian"* ([You can take a look at the setup here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GH3mbvUro)).
It's a translator that receives a morse code input and converts it into a servo motor rotation. A semicircle of hexadecimal numbers surrounds the device and the pointer, which is placed on the servo motor, 
will then point to the corresponding hexadecimal number.

*Hardware*:
- 1x Arduino Microcontroller (e.g. Arduino Uno)
- 1x Servo motor attachment for the Arduino
- 1x Button
- 1x LED (optional)
- 1x Breadboard
- Cables:
	- 1x Micro-USB Cable
	- 1x Servo motor - Microcontroller connection cable
	- 1x Power Cable
	- 2x Grounding Cables
	- 2x Communication Cables
	
*Unity Integration*:
The setup is also simulated in unity with a communication-interface (via serial COM Ports) to the arduino and vis versa.
